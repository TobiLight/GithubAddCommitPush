# GithubAddCommitPush

Github shell script to commit and push your changes.

# PS: You can modify the script to add specified files instead of all the files.

## How to use
1. Cd into push2github.
2. Copy the [.bash_aliases](./.bash_aliases) file to your root directory; ex. `cp .bash_aliases /root`. You can type `ls` to confirm it's in the root directory.
3. Type`. .bashrc` or `. ~/.bashrc` in your terminal (This will execute and reload the Bash configuration settings in the `.bashrc` file making changes or additions we just made to the file immediately available in our shell session.).
4. Now you can use the script anywhere in your local git repository. Type `push` and it will prompt you for your commit message. Bye bye to git add .; git commit -m "This is stressful"; git push.
5. T for thanks and thanks for coming. :v:
